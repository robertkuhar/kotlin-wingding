"Classes and Objects", "Delegation"

- The by-clause gets you delegation to the parent for free.  Sweet.

"Delegated Properties"

- "There are certain common kinds of properties, that, though we can implement them manually every time we need them,
would be very nice to implement once and for all, and put into a library"
- its pretty much "up the middle" how you would expect it to be done
- "The Kotlin standard library provides factory methods for several useful kinds of delegates."
  - Lazy is cool.  It is interesting that it is synchronized
    - I think LazyThreadSafetyMode.PUBLICATION and LazyThreadSafetyMode.NONE is kind-of a cop out
  - Observable and Vetoable are also neat
    - It would have been nice to be able to return more information about a vetoed descision
  - I really don't get "Storing Properties in a Map":  https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/delegated-properties.html#storing-properties-in-a-map
    - what exactly does it get me?
